Machine learning model implementations with information about model "goodness"

I have explored different machine learning algorithms(K-NN, regression, SVM) to predict whether a cancer is malign or benign. I have also measured the "goodness" of the algorithm using different plots like ROC curve, lift curve.

I have then measured the performance of same algorithms(K-NN, regression, SVM) on categorical data. This data was first treated using one-hot encoding and then the "goodness" of the algorithm was measured.
